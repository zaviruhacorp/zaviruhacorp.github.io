        <h2>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</h2>

        <p>
            <strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I had so many things that i thought
            that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there
            was too much.
        </p>
        <p>
            Things were terrible. I had a job I hated, a home that I didn't want
            to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
        </p>

        <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>I wan on the verge of breakdown when I got rid of everything</strong>.
            I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into
            a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such bad place, I
            didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
        </p>

        <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
        <p>
            Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed,
            enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
            With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt lake I had no choice but
        to start sharing how i did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from living a
            simple life ass well, which is why I started this site!
